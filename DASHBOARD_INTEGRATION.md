- Handles loading states and errors
- Provides refresh functionality

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Screen (`screens/Dashboard.js`)

## API Response Structure

The dashboard API returns the following data structure:

```json
{
  "date": "2025-08-19",
  "user_name": "ashwamedh_medicare",
  "punch_status": {
    "punched_in": true,
    "punched_out": true,
    "punch_in_time": "08:43:59",
    "punch_out_time": "09:00:19",
    "punch_id": 198
  },
  "visit_summary": {
    "total_visits": 0,
    "farmer_visits": 0,
    "dealer_visits": 0,
    "unique_dealers_visited": 0,
    "unique_farmers_visited": 0
  },
  "working_hours": 0.27,
  "recent_visits": []
}
```

## Benefits for Employees

1. **Daily Overview**: Quick glance at their daily work summary
2. **Time Tracking**: Clear visibility of punch times and working hours
3. **Performance Metrics**: Visit counts and unique contacts tracked
4. **Real-time Updates**: Data refreshes after each action
5. **Easy Access**: All information available on the main dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. Dashboard loads → Fetches API data
2. Displays statistics in organized cards
3. User performs actions (punch in/out) → Auto-refreshes data
4. Pull-to-refresh available for manual updates

### Error Handling

- Network errors gracefully handled
- Fallback to existing punch API if dashboard API fails
- User-friendly error messages
- Cached data support through existing client

### Performance

- Efficient API calls (only when needed)
- Optimized rendering with proper loading states
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

## Future Enhancements

- Recent visits list display
- Daily/weekly/monthly views
- Performance analytics
- Export functionality
- Notifications for milestones

The dashboard now provides employees with comprehensive insights into their daily activities, helping them track their performance and stay motivated!
